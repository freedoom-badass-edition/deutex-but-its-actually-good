DeuTex but it's actually good
=============================

This program is Deutex but:

* Unrestricted level names

Building and installing
-----------------------

DeuTex uses an Autoconf+Automake build system, so its compilation and
installation process is identical to most other Unix packages:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

When building directly from the version control repository, you will
need autoconf and automake installed and run the `./bootstrap` command
first to generate the `./configure` file.

To build and install the manpage, AsciiDoc must be installed, in
particular the DocBook-based `a2x` command for transforming it into
manpage format.  DeuTex will still build without it, however, and the
AsciiDoc source in +man/deutex.txt+ is fairly readable on its own.

To build and install on ReactOS or Microsoft Windows will require an
environment compatible with Unix shells and programs, such as
https://cygwin.com/[Cygwin] or http://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2].
